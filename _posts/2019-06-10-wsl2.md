# Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 : A revolution ?

In a previous blog post I presented WSL a Microsoft technology to have true Linux user spaces on Windows 10. The future of WSL seems all drawn. With more siscall implementation, better performaces and better interoperability. It was true Until Windows 10 May 2019 Update (1903) but at build 2019 Microsoft was annonced WSL2 a all new architecture for the core of WSL. in this blog post we seen the difference between WSL2 and WSL1 how to use it and the pro and coins of wsl2 compared to WSL1

# A all new Architecture

## A true Linux kernel

In the previous version of WSL a compatibility lawyer provided by `lxcore.sys` is used to emulate the `Linux`kernel by this way it's easyer to provide `Windows`<=> `Linux`interop but that cause a performance issue on File IO and it's also a very long job for the WSL team at Microsoft to implement all `Linux`Syscall

The new strategy reveal at Build 2019 is to [include a true `Linux`kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/shipping-a-linux-kernel-with-windows/) tuned for WSL on `Windows`. This job was made by the new Linux Systems Group team at Microsoft. This kernel are used above WSL2 distro instead of the couple `lxss.sys` driver+`Windows NT` kernel.

## Two kernel on same Machine

In order to use this kernel Microsoft use a lightweight VM (The same technology use by Microsoft for the `Windows sandbox` on Windows 10 Pro version 1903)
