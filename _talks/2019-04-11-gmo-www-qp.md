The presentation I made for the GMO group talked about the web demo I realised by using [shellinabox](https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox), [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com). Thanks to the demo you can try [Quantum Package](https://quantumpackage.github.io/qp2/) directly on your web browser before installing it.

This presentation started with a litle slideshow followed by a live demo.
