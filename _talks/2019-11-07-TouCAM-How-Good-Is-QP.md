This poster session at the [TouCAM2019](https://toucam2019.sciencesconf.org/) presented a live demo of Quantum Package and my work to make Quantum Package easy to test [online](https://quantumpackage.github.io/qp2/page/try/).

We choose the poster format to allow the attendees to ask any questions and adapt the demo to their expectations.
