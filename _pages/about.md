My name is {{ site.author.name }}.

I am a {{ site.author.bio }} at {{ site.author.employer }} at the [Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantique](http://www.lcpq.ups-tlse.fr).

I mainly worked on a [webapp](https://lcpq.github.io/QUESTDB_website) for the the [QUEST project](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c00014) (for more information you can read the [related publication](/files/2021-02-17-QUESTDB-A-database-of-highly-accurate-excitation-energies-for-the-electronic-structure-community.pdf)). the aims of this project is to provide reference data of excitation energies calculated by different quantum chemistry methods. Further on thanks to the webapp  we can compare their accuracy on various sets of molecules using statistics calculated by the webapp. Data may also come from user files in order to compare the accuracy of new methods with those referenced.

During the first year of my PhD I developed a web demo of the quantum chemistry software Quantum Package. You can try Quantum Package on the web with this [demo](https://quantumpackage.github.io/qp2/page/try). A presentation of the demo can be found [here](/talks/2019-04-11-gmo-www-qp).
